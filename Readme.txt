CodeBreaker – Guess the number game

Here, the computer will think of a three digit number that has no repeating digits. You will then guess a three digit number and the computer will then give back clues. Based on these clues you will keep guessing until you break the code with a match.

The possible clues are:

Close – You’ve guessed a correct number but in the wrong position.
Match – You’ve guessed a correct number in the correct position.
Nope – You haven’t guessed any of the numbers correctly.
